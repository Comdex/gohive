# `git.apache.org/thrift.git`

GoHive talks to HiveServer2, a Thrift server that relies on a very old version of Thrift that is not trivial to find and install nowadays.  To make it convenient to build GoHive, we copied this Thrift version here.  Given that HiveServer2 has been depending on this version for a long time, it doesn't seem that the Hive team is going to upgrade the Thrift version frequently.  If they do, we will update this directory.
